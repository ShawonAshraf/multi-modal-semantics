1. Average accuracy was 0.4. First I took the mean accuracy for each selected object for the prompts in the list and then took the overall mean. 

2. Totally wrong predictions: Ketchup, Light Bulbs, Asparagus, Sea Turtles, Flashlights. As for other wrong results, such as Ambulance, Giraffe, Canoes, Limousine, Jeans etc. 
can have multiple colors.

3. Objects can variations in their colors and patterns of these colors. Some can have only a single color some can have multiple. As it is evident from the analysis that even 
single colors are diffiult to predict from just natural language. Perhaps this can be improved with complex prompt patterns but coming up with all possible patterns to 
capture color knowledge from text or language alone is infeasible.
