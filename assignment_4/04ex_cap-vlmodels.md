## Exercise 1

### (a)

#### VL Models: Minimal Accounting

- Visual Coreference

#### VL Models: Better than Linguistic Models

- Word Sense Disambiguation
- Common Ground (Slightly better)

#### Linguistic models better than VL Models

- Action-Effect Understanding
- Perception of Color
- Verb Understanding

### (b)

Fusion models have been shown to have a better understanding of cross-modal interaction. Also, CLIP has shown adeptness at Action Understanding. However for the verb understanding anaylsis, CLIP was not considered.

Overall, Fusion models are better poised for tasks where text modality is the dominant source of information of contrastive models such as CLIP.

### (c)

- Text is more ambiguous than Images.
- The dominance of the textual modality dicates how a VL model will perform on a specific linguistic task. (Some VL will tend to perform better due to their Language Models being better suited at capturing the information).
